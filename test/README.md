# /test

The `test` directory contains our site tests.  

We have yet to decide on a testing framework, though several nice frameworks are [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/), [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/), and [qUnit](http://qunitjs.com/). 

Notice the first two are hosted on Github! Why don't we do something like that? Check this sort of this out [here](http://pages.github.com/).
